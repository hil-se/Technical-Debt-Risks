## Projects

### Better self-admitted technical debt identification with adaptive CNN.

Aug 2020 | [repo](https://github.com/hil-se/Technical-Debt-Risks#top)

This project aims to improve efficiency of self-admitted technical debt identification with an adaptive CNN model.
 - Incorporate a CNN model in the framework of a human-in-the-loop self-admitted technical debt identification system.
 - Explore ways to efficiently update the CNN model with incrementally obtained labels.
 - Make the prediction model of CNN adaptive to the target software project.
